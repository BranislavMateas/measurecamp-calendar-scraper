 ne\nAddress: MeasureCamp Melbourne 2026: The Global Movement ReturnsWe are
  thrilled to announce thatMeasureCamp Melbourne 2026will officially take p
 lace onJanuary 21st. Following in the footsteps of the original London eve
 nt and its hugely successful counterparts around the globe\, this gatherin
 g is set to once again unite the local analytics community in a celebratio
 n of shared knowledge and open dialogue.What is an Unconference?Unlike tra
 ditional conferences where you sit passively through pre-planned lectures\
 , MeasureCamp turns the format on its head. It is a true “unconference
 ”—a dynamic event where the agenda is a blank canvas at the start of t
 he day. The schedule is built in real-time by you\, the attendees. This un
 ique structure breaks down the barriers between “speakers” and “audi
 ence.” Whether you are a seasoned industry veteran\, a vendor\, or a fre
 sh graduate\, the floor is open for you to lead a session\, spark a debate
 \, or share a case study.Why You Should AttendMeasureCamp is designed to b
 e the antidote to the rigid\, one-way presentations of corporate summits. 
 By fostering a collaborative social framework\, we create an environment w
 here the “hallway track”—those valuable\, spontaneous conversations
 —becomes the main event.The small\, intimate discussion groups encourage
  active participation rather than passive listening. This format ensures t
 hat the content is always relevant because it is defined and curated by th
 e people in the room. It is the ultimate opportunity to learn from the bes
 t\, develop your skills\, and network with peers and consultants in an atm
 osphere that champions curiosity over hierarchy.Come prepared to teach\, r
 eady to learn\, and eager to connect. At MeasureCamp\, you don’t just at
 tend the event\; you create it.With thanks to our Sponsors:Silver Sponsors
