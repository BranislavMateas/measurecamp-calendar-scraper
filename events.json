It is a true \u201cunconference\u201d\u2014a dynamic event where the agenda is a blank canvas at the start of the day. The schedule is built in real-time by you, the attendees.

By fostering a collaborative social framework, we create an environment where the \u201challway track\u201d\u2014those valuable, spontaneous conversations\u2014becomes the main event.The small, intimate discussion groups encourage active participation rather than passive listening. This format ensures that the content is always relevant because it is defined and curated by the people in the room. It is the ultimate opportunity to learn from the best, develop your skills, and network with peers and consultants in an atmosphere that champions curiosity over hierarchy.Come prepared to teach, ready to learn, and eager to connect. At MeasureCamp, you don\u2019t just attend the event; you create it.With thanks to our Sponsors:Silver Sponsors",
